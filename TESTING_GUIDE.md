## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue: "System not found" errors**
**Solution**: Make sure all system scripts are attached to GameObjects in the scene

#### **Issue: UI elements not showing**
**Solution**: Check that UI components are properly assigned in the Inspector

#### **Issue: Game not starting**
**Solution**: Verify GameManager is in the scene and has all required references

#### **Issue: Null reference exceptions**
**Solution**: The ErrorHandler will catch these - check the Console for details
